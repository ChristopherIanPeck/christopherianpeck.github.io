                    Welcome!
                    <p></p>
                    My name is Chris, and I am a motivated Computer Science and Mathematics student 
                    with a strong passion for leveraging analytical and computational methods to solve 
                    real-world problems. My academic journey and hands-on projects reflect my dedication 
                    to exploring the intersection of mathematics, technology, and data-driven decision-making.
                    <p></p>
                    This portfolio highlights my skills, experiences, and achievements in these domains. I aspire 
                    to build a career where I can contribute to innovative solutions in the realms of computational 
                    science, data analysis, and mathematical modeling.
                    <p></p>
                    Thank you for visiting! I invite you to explore my work and look forward to discussing potential 
                    opportunities for collaboration or employment.</p>

			Welcome!
                    <p></p>
			I’m Chris, a Computer Science and Mathematics student who loves turning ideas into practical solutions.
			Whether it’s through coding, data analysis, or creative problem-solving, I enjoy diving into challenges and finding smarter, more efficient ways to get things done.
                    <p></p>
			This portfolio is a snapshot of the skills I’ve built, the projects I’ve explored, and the curiosity that drives me forward.
			My goal is simple: keep learning, keep creating, and keep making an impact wherever I can.
                    <p></p>
			Thanks for stopping by — feel free to look around, and let’s connect if you see something that sparks an idea.
